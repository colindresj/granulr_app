WDI_User_Story_Project

##Fall 2013 WDI Group Project - Colindres, Oynick, Rothpearl, Vander Hoop

###User Stories:


As an ambitious human,
I want to clearly define and organize my goals, and create accountability across a team,
So I can better manage and reach my goals.

As a new user,
I want to create an account,
so that I can create a profile with a picture on it.

As an unlogged in user, 
I want to be able to log in, 
so that I can access my profile.

As a new logged in user,
I want to be taken to my dashboard,
so I can create my first project. 

As a logged in user,
I want to be be able to sign out of my account,
so I can keep my information from 

As a logged in user, 
I want to be able to click “New Probject”, 
so I can be taken to the New Project Creation window.

As a logged in user on the New Alpha Story Creation Window,
I want to be able to create an Alpha Story and click save, so I can save the Alpha Story to the database and be taken to the user dashboard page, so that I can see my alpha stories, as well as a button to add a new Alpha Story. 

As a user who has just saved their first Alpha story, 
I want to be able to click into any Alpha Story, where I will see the Alpha Story as a header, so that I have an ever-present reference for my top-level goal.

As a user inside a particular Alpha Story, I want to be able to create a Beta Story and click save, so I can save the Beta Story to the database as a child of its Alpha Story, and be taken to that Alpha Story page, so that I can see the Beta stories belonging to said Alpha Story, as well as a button to add a new Beta Story as a sibling. 

As a user inside a particular Beta Story, I want to be able to create a Gamma Story and click save, so I can save the Gamma Story to the database as a child of its Beta Story, and be taken to that Beta Story page, so that I can see the Gamma stories belonging to said Beta Story, as well as a button to add a new Gamma Story as a sibling. 
Assuming a user has Alpha > Beta > Gamma stories, the user should be able to mark stories at the lowest level (gamma) complete. Once all stories at the gamma level are complete, the user is alert with a congrats and a gentle push to mark the beta ‘complete’. 

This process is repeated on the beta level.

As a user that has Alpha > Beta > Gamma stories, I want to be able to delete from any point of the story tree and be prompted with warnings, both A) if the story I’m deleting has children (in which case, it will ask if I want to recursively delete) and B) if I want to delete the story, period, so that we don’t delete things by accident. 

As a user that has Alpha > Beta > Gamma stories, I want to be able to edit the story I’m in so that I can better articulate or adjust my goal/task.

The Alpha story should have a title, so that months down the road, you’re not looking for your goal stories and seeing a bunch that start “As a better husband, I want to” Or maybe the “I want to” field becomes the title?
